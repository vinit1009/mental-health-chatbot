Sure, let's define the project scope and objectives for your mental health chatbot. I'll provide a detailed outline based on typical requirements for such a project. Feel free to adjust or expand upon these details as you see fit.

Step 1: Define Project Scope and Objectives
1.1 Identify the Purpose of the Chatbot
Primary Goal: The chatbot aims to provide initial mental health support, guidance, and information. It's designed to offer a friendly and empathetic conversational interface for users seeking advice or information about mental well-being.
User Engagement: The chatbot will engage users through interactive, supportive conversations. It will answer questions, provide tips for mental health care, and offer resources for further help.
1.2 Define Core Functionalities
Conversational Abilities: The chatbot will be capable of understanding natural language inputs, managing context in conversation, and providing relevant, empathetic responses.
Content Scope: The chatbot will cover a range of mental health topics, including stress management, mindfulness, coping strategies for common mental health issues, and information about mental health resources.
Emergency Handling: In cases where a user exhibits signs of severe distress or mentions emergencies, the chatbot will provide contact information for crisis helplines and suggest seeking professional help.
1.3 Target Audience
User Demographics: The primary users are adults (ages 18 and above) who are seeking initial advice or information about mental health. The chatbot is designed to be user-friendly for individuals with varying levels of tech-savviness.
Accessibility Considerations: The chatbot's interface will be designed to be accessible, including clear language, straightforward navigation, and compatibility with screen readers for visually impaired users.
1.4 User Data Handling and Privacy
Data Storage: Minimal data will be stored, primarily for the purpose of improving conversation flows and maintaining context in discussions. User-specific data will be anonymized to protect privacy.
Privacy Policy: The chatbot will comply with relevant data protection laws, such as GDPR, ensuring user data is handled responsibly. Users will be informed about the data collection and its purpose.
1.5 Documentation
A document will be created outlining:
The chatbotâ€™s purpose of providing initial mental health support.
Its capabilities in handling conversations on mental health topics.
Target audience details and accessibility features.
Data handling practices and adherence to privacy regulations.
Completion of Step 1
With this framework, you have a clear understanding of what your chatbot is set out to achieve, its functionalities, the target audience it serves, and how it will handle user data and privacy. This forms the foundation of your project and guides the subsequent development stages.

Let me know if this aligns with your vision for the chatbot or if there are any modifications you'd like to make. Once you're comfortable with this step, we can proceed to the next one!
